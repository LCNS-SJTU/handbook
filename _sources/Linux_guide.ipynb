    "\n",
    "### Unix\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix is an operating system that originally developmented at the Bell Labs, by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others in 1970s. Ken Thompson invented the B programming language, the direct predecessor to the C programming language, Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language.\n",
    "Unix's genius design and continuing improvements make it popular and long lasting till today. What's more, other modern operating systems (including Mac and Windows) is significantly influenced by Unix's design and spirit also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long Live Unix!\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] [UNIX演义](https://bbs.sjtu.edu.cn/bbs0an,path,%2Fgroups%2FGROUP%5F3%2FUnix%2FD915C16C6%2FDA27A696E.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux is a spiritual successor to the original Unix system. Both of them (and also macOS) are mostly POSIX-compliant [2]. POSIX [1] is a standard that maintain software compatibility between variants of Unix and other operating systems. For example, C source code should be (almost) interchangeable between (almost) POSIX-compliant systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say the system is Unix-like, we usually mean the system is mostly POSIX-compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "POSIX standard covers general concepts, system interfaces, shell & utilities etc. It is unlikely that you will need to read it as a beginner or even as an experienced user.\n",
    "\n",

    "### GNU and Free Software (自由软件)\n",
    "\n",
    "GNU means GNU's Not Unix. ;-)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the name of a software project lead by Richard Stallman (RMS). The GNU project aims to create a free operating system and a free software toolchain on top of it, by collaborative developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Free* means: the users are free to *run* the software, *share* it (copy and distribute), study it, and *modify* it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to (legally) guarantee these freedom, a licence is necessary: The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL), which is a \"copyleft\" licence, in contrast to \"copyright\". In simple words, it means that you must publish your source code and licence it under GPL, if it is a derivative work from a GPL licenced code and you are distributing or selling it (with or without charge). See [2,3] for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Software in GNU projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "  GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), GNU C library (glibc), GNU Bash shell, GNU Core Utilities (i.e. basic Linux commands), GNOME desktop environment, GNU Octave, GNU Emacs, GIMP (\"photoshop\" for Linux), Gnumeric (MS Excel compatible).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of GPL or LGPL licenced or GPL/LGPL compatible softwares:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Linux, Firefox, Python, Android (the core part), TensorFlow, 7z, LyX, pdfTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of NON GPL/LGPL compatible softwares\n",
    "\n",
    "* Intel Math Kernel Library, i.e. MKL (Freeware, but not opensource, not free to share).\n",
    "* Matlab\n",
    "* macOS\n",
    "* QQ, WeChat, Skype\n",
    "* MS Word, MS Excel, Visual Studio, etc.\n",

    "### Linux Distributions (发行版)\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux kernel together with a large set of user softwares (in a place called software repository). e.g. Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, you will use a \"Linux distributions\" instead of assembling a Linux kernal and user softwares yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Linux distributions focus on out-of-the-box (Ubuntu), some focus on bleeding edge software (Arch, Fedora), some focus on stability (Debian, CentOS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software Repository (软件仓库/软件源)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also called software source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software repository is a website that stores and publishes a collection of free softwares that specifically tuned for the distribution. The repository is maintained by developers of the distribution and possibly the original author of the individual software. The softwares in the repository could come from everywhere, e.g. GNU projects, amateur projects, academic projects, and commercial projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software repository could also contain non-free softwares, non-free in the sense that they are not GPL or LGPL compatible. e.g. mp3 decoding and encoding technology (patented, but expired 2017, now totally free), nvidia-driver (not open source).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Choose Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "* No annoying advertisement, more safe\n",
    "\n",
    "  Mostly, you will install softwares from the software repository. Softwares from official repository are verified and will be securely downloaded, thus avoid the risk of malicious softwares, and with no ads. High priority security fix will be patched in a urgent pace (within few days after been found).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let *you* control your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "  No unwanted background programs running e.g. automatic software updata, force system reboot, virus scan, unexplained internet traffic or CPU usage etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  No hiding/joking of CPU usage, network traffic, RAM usage etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Source code are available, when in doubt, or want to make some improvement, or want to learn from it, just check its source code (apt-get source _packagename_).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run faster\n",
    "\n",
    "  Linux has a better CPU scheduler and RAM memory management compared to Windows in general. Thus programs could run a few percent (sometimes more than 10 percent) faster after transplant to Linux. e.g., it is observed that Linux version of Mathematica is faster than its Windows version, likely Matlab behaves the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rich set of tools for advanced user\n",
    "    - For administration of system\n",
    "    \n",
    "        See hardware details without installing extra softwares.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Highly configurable and with fair documentation (man).\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Good for batch processing\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Easy to automate complex procedures.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - For programming\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Pre-installed gcc and python. Nice editors (vim, gedit). Powerful debug/profiling tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A lot of research-oriented programs are developed under Linux, or best running under Linux. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "   - LaTeX (run faster, much easier to install)\n",
    "   - NEST Simulator (Linux only?)\n",
    "   - NEURON (Linux only)\n",
    "   - GNU Octave (much faster)\n",
    "   - FFTW, LAPACK (much easier to compile)\n",
    "   - TensorFlow (much easier to compile)\n",
    "   - ssh (you can have Graphical user interface, without using vnc)\n",
    "\n",
    "* 100% of world top 500 super computers are running Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "  At Jun. 2004, for the first time, more than 50% of super computers are running Linux. Then soon Linux dominate super computer list (85% at 2007), eventually reaches 100% at Nov. 2017 and remains today.\n",

    "    2. QQ, wechat. (alternatives: use web based wechat, http://wx.qq.com/)\n",

    "#### Create a new virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one basic command in `virtualenv`.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ virtualenv ENV\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `ENV` is a directory in which to place the new virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Options\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `-p PYTHON_EXE, --python=PYTHON_EXE`: The Python interpreter to use, e.g., `--python=python3.7` will use the python3.7 interpreter to create the new environment. You may choose other interpreters installed in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `--system-site-packages`: If you build with it, your virtual environment will inherit packages from your global site-package directories. If you want isolation from the global system and manage your own packages, do not use this flag.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Activate script\n",
    "\n",
    "In a newly created virtualenv there will also be a activate shell script. On Posix systems, this resides in `/ENV/bin/`, so you can run\n",

    "#### Removing an Environment\n",
    "\n",
